    <p class="first">Hamlet is one of the most powerful Shakespearean tragedies, perhaps best known for Hamlet's immortalised line, “to be or not to be." This play is a classic tale of betrayal, murder and revenge. Prince Hamlet of Denmark is incited by ghostly apparitions of his dead father, who wants revenge against his supposed murderer, Claudius, the prince's uncle. Claudius seizes both the throne and marries his dead brother’s wife, Gertrude.</p>
    <p>The prince’s initial plot to kill Claudius fails, with him killing his sweetheart Ophelia’s father instead. When prince is sent to England by Claudius, he chances upon Ophelia’s funeral, and returns to Denmark to seek final revenge. While Gertrude is killed by drinking poison meant for the prince, Claudius incites a duel between prince and Laertes, Ophelia’s brother. Both the men are fatally wounded by poisoned blades during the duel, but Hamlet kills Claudius before succumbing to his injuries.</p>
